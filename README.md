# Audible HQ Cover Userscript 🐒

A userscript for getting that sweet HQ version of the Audible book cover 😙👌🏻.

> Audible typically displays a `500x500px` cover image, but higher resolution versions (up to `2400x2400px`) are available through their API. This userscript provides easy access to these high-quality images.

**Features:**

- **Open HQ Cover**: Click the cover to open the high-quality version in a new tab (usually `2400x2400px`).
- **Interactive Buttons**: On hover, two buttons appear on the cover:
  - **Download**: Save the HQ cover to your device.
  - **Load**: Replace the displayed cover with the HQ version, useful for dragging or copying to the clipboard.

*Note: The displayed cover is not replaced by default to save bandwidth. A configurable option for this feature may be added in the future.*
